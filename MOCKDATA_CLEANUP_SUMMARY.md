# Mock Data Cleanup Summary

## Issue Fixed
Resolved the build error: `Failed to resolve import "@/services/mockData" from "client/src/pages/ManageShop.tsx"`

## Root Cause
The mock data service (`client/src/services/mockData.ts`) was removed as part of the production cleanup, but several components were still importing and using it, causing build failures.

## Files Modified

### 1. ManageShop.tsx
- **Issue**: Imported `mockShopOwners` from deleted mockData service
- **Solution**: Replaced with proper authentication flow using `useAuth` context
- **Change**: Now redirects authenticated merchants to dashboard, unauthenticated users to login

### 2. ShopOwnerLogin.tsx  
- **Issue**: Used `mockShopOwners` for demo login selection
- **Solution**: Replaced with authentication redirect logic
- **Change**: Redirects to proper login page instead of demo selection

### 3. ShopManagement.tsx
- **Issue**: Called `mockDataService.updateShop()` and `mockDataService.createShop()`
- **Solution**: Replaced with `dataService` API calls and made function async
- **Change**: Now uses real database operations via dataService

## Technical Changes

### Authentication Flow Improvements
- Removed demo/mock authentication flows
- Implemented proper redirect logic based on user authentication state
- All shop management now requires proper authentication

### Data Service Usage
- Replaced mock data operations with real database calls
- Added async/await patterns for database operations
- Improved error handling for production use

### Code Cleanup
- Removed all references to deleted mock data service
- Eliminated demo-specific user interfaces
- Streamlined authentication redirects

## Production Impact

### ✅ Benefits
- **Security**: No more demo/mock authentication bypasses
- **Data Integrity**: All operations now use real database
- **User Experience**: Proper authentication flow for all users
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner codebase without mock data dependencies

### ⚠️ Notes
- TypeScript errors remain in other parts of the codebase but don't affect the core functionality
- Build now succeeds without import errors
- Application can start and function with real authentication

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
The mock data import error has been completely resolved. The application now builds successfully and uses proper authentication and data services throughout.
