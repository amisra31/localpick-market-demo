# Order Status Sync - Implementation Testing Guide

## 🔧 Implementation Summary

### ✅ Completed Features

1. **Centralized OrderService** (`server/services/orderService.ts`)
   - Status validation and transition rules
   - Audit logging for all status changes
   - Real-time WebSocket broadcasting
   - Unified API for order cancellation

2. **Enhanced WebSocket Manager** (`server/websocket.ts`)
   - New broadcast methods: `broadcastToUser()`, `broadcastToRole()`, `broadcastToShop()`
   - Support for order status update messages
   - Proper user targeting and role-based messaging

3. **Updated API Endpoints** (`server/routes/orders.ts`)
   - Merchant status updates use OrderService
   - Customer cancellation uses OrderService
   - Proper permissions and ownership validation
   - Real-time broadcasting integrated

4. **Frontend WebSocket Integration**
   - New `useOrderWebSocket` hook for real-time order updates
   - Merchant dashboard with live order status sync
   - Customer reservations page with live status updates
   - Role-specific filtering and notifications

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Merchant Updates Order Status

**Test Steps:**
1. Login as merchant
2. Go to merchant dashboard → Orders section
3. Change order status (e.g., Pending → In Progress)
4. **Expected Result:** 
   - Customer should see status update in real-time
   - Order status changes immediately in customer's "My Reservations"
   - Toast notification appears on merchant side
   - Database logs the status change

### Scenario 2: Customer Cancels Order

**Test Steps:**
1. Login as customer
2. Go to "My Reservations" page
3. Click "Cancel" on an active order
4. **Expected Result:**
   - Merchant sees order disappear or change to "Cancelled" status
   - Real-time notification on merchant dashboard
   - Order removed from customer's reservation list
   - Database status updated to "cancelled"

### Scenario 3: Real-time Sync Validation

**Test Steps:**
1. Open merchant dashboard in one browser tab
2. Open customer reservations in another tab (same order)
3. Update order status from merchant side
4. **Expected Result:**
   - Customer page updates instantly
   - No page refresh required
   - Status change visible immediately

## 🔍 Status Transition Rules

```typescript
const validTransitions = {
  'pending': ['reserved', 'in_progress', 'cancelled'],
  'reserved': ['in_progress', 'delivered', 'cancelled'],
  'in_progress': ['delivered', 'cancelled'],
  'delivered': [], // Cannot change from delivered
  'cancelled': [] // Cannot change from cancelled
};
```

## 📡 WebSocket Message Format

**Order Status Update Message:**
```json
{
  "type": "order_status_updated",
  "payload": {
    "orderId": "abc123",
    "customerId": "customer123",
    "shopId": "shop456",
    "previousStatus": "pending",
    "newStatus": "in_progress",
    "order": { /* full order object */ },
    "product": { /* product details */ },
    "shop": { /* shop details */ },
    "timestamp": 1640995200000
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Key Implementation Details

### Permissions & Security
- Merchants can only update orders for their own shops
- Customers can only cancel their own orders
- Admin users can perform all order operations
- All actions require authentication

### Real-time Broadcasting
- **Customer Updates:** Broadcast to specific customer by user ID
- **Merchant Updates:** Broadcast to shop merchants + customer
- **Admin Updates:** Broadcast to all admin dashboards
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation if WebSocket unavailable

### Database Consistency
- All status changes logged in `order_status_changes` table
- Atomic operations with proper error handling
- Audit trail maintained for compliance

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **WebSocket Fallback:** If WebSocket connection fails, polling mechanism still works (10-second interval)
2. **Backward Compatibility:** localStorage sync maintained for existing code
3. **Performance:** Real-time updates don't trigger full data reloads
4. **Error Handling:** Failed status updates don't break the UI

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Real-time updates not working
**Solution:** Check WebSocket connection status in browser dev tools

### Issue: Status update fails
**Solution:** Verify user permissions and order ownership

### Issue: Customer not receiving updates
**Solution:** Ensure customer is authenticated and WebSocket is connected

## 🎉 Success Criteria

- ✅ Merchant can update order status with immediate customer notification
- ✅ Customer can cancel orders with immediate merchant notification  
- ✅ All order status changes are logged and auditable
- ✅ Real-time sync works bidirectionally
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Graceful handling of connection failures
